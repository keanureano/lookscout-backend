# Lookscout Demo
This project showcases how a full-stack demo website works. It consists of a React frontend, Node.js/Express.js API, and an admin panel. The backend code enables logo upload, button text customization, and the display of names and emails, while the frontend code features a multi-step form modal with tooltips and dynamic button text retrieval from the API.


``PS: If you're viewing the website, please wait for 30-60 seconds to as the rende.io website needs time to start up.``
